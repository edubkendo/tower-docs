# Getting Started

Tower is a lightweight framework for building JavaScript web applications.  Tower follows the same principles as Rails, giving you a clear MVC convention that makes building large-scale JavaScript apps fun and real easy.  It was built to allow you to write one set of JavaScript code that works on both the client and server.  It's crazy how much faster you can move with just that one small change.

Tower was written with CoffeeScript in mind.  It uses Rails-esque conventions, and a Ruby-like syntax, so your app is built with classes.  You don't have to use these conventions, and you can are free to write your app in purely JavaScript.  But the CoffeeScript version makes it super easy to do a lot.

Tower is extremely lightweight, coming in at 10k minified and gzipped.
