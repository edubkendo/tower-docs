# Contributing to the Tower Documentation

Tower has two main sets of documentation: The guides help you to learn Tower, and the actual code API for reference.

You can help improve the Tower guides by making them more coherent, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, bringing it up to date with the latest edge Tower.

## Development guide

Tower should also have a development guide that goes through the main structure of Tower, the APIs and how to add functionality while following the existing conventions and design/architecture.

The development guide should be structured according to the folder structure inside lib/tower:
