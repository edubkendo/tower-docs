# To New Coders

If you've never coded before, learn this.  Node.js is the platform of the future, JavaScript is the language.

If you spend the time to learn JavaScript and Node.js, you will be able to implement your crazy ideas and change the world.

Ideas without the ability to code are pretty much useless (unless you're either in your late 30s+ and very well connected, a multi-millionaire, or a prodigy leader and storyteller).

## Getting Real

Coding is pretty hard.  It's going to take you several years to start being able to build apps.  It's going to take at least 10,000 hours before you can start pumping them out.  That's 7 years on average.

You tell yourself, "well, I'm 25, that means I'll be 32 before I can start making my ideas a reality!?!  Fuck that."

Good point.  Just sit on your ass the next seven years sending emails to Google and Facebook with your "game changing idea", and hope they get so excited that they give you all the resources you'd ever need to build out your vision.

Even better, buy some lottery tickets.  That's the best strategy for success.

Haha, read Brian Tracy's [Focal Point](http://www.amazon.com/Focal-Point-Simplify-Productivity-Achieve/dp/0814471293).  It's short.  It's a must.

Really though, coding is hard.

But if you devote enough time to it you will be good at it no problem.  It's not hard like you'd imagine math is hard, it's just like learning a language.  Once you get the basics it's pretty easy.  After a few months you'll get some basic demos up and going.  After a year and a half, you'll be able to build a startup no problem.

## What To Learn

- HTML (and HTML Template Languages)
- CSS (and CSS Template Languages)
- JavaScript (and jQuery, Node.js and CoffeeScript)
- NoSQL Databases (MongoDB and Redis)
- Heroku
- Unix (the "command line")
- TextMate (on a Mac)
- Markdown
- GitHub

Personally, I like to first have something in mind that I want to create, and then sort of reverse engineer it.  So maybe you want to start with JavaScript, but then to make a page you'll have to learn HTML and CSS, so you learn that as needed.  If you're hardcore like that, go for it.

For y'all who like structure, here's an outline on how you might learn the above skills.

**Spend about 2 weeks playing around with HTML**.  That's all it really takes.  When you ask people if they program, a lot of people say, "yeah, I've done some HTML before".  Sorry, but HTML isn't programming.  HTML is a "markup language", which means basically you just organize a set of 30 or so keywords into a tree structure that create the layout of a web page.  Sounds complicated, but it's super basic stuff.

CSS means "Cascading Style Sheets".  CSS is basically a simple markup language that defines the layout, colors, typography, and design of the HTML elements.  CSS is a little more complicated though, because each browser has their own implementation of it (meaning some CSS rule might cause an HTML element to be drawn differently in Chrome vs. Internet Explorer).  **Spend 2 weeks just with CSS**, trying to make as many different looking things you can...  Pages with multiple columns, paragraphs with text wrapping around images, simple grids of images, etc.  Mess with the spacing between elements, think about white space.  Try to make things look good.  When something just isn't working, find a solution in google.  Sometimes the simplest things seem impossible (like vertically centering an image with CSS, seems easy but it's pretty hard at first).

**After about a month, you'll be making simple, static HTML pages that look nice**.  That's more than most people.

Then use some JavaScript to animate links on rollover.  Have fun with that.  At first just learn the JavaScript you need "right now", to make your animation or whatever.  Once you're starting to feel comfortable with that, get a book on JavaScript and learn it well.  If you enjoy learning though, get the book right off the bat and practice everything -- it pays off big time.  The goal, though, is to make it through at least 3 months of simple JavaScript practice.  If you can get over that hump, you're in for good.  **Spend at least a month with JavaScript, if not 3 months up front**.

At this point, I'd start learning how to use GitHub.  Pump out some examples, write some blog posts on random little tips you stumble across in the learning process to help others along the way.

If you've gotten this far, then I don't need to describe anything more to you.  Learn Node.js, Unix, MongoDB, and Heroku and you'll be able to start implementing your vision for changing the world.
