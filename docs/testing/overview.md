# Testing Overview

Tower uses these three libraries for testing:

- [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha): The async TDD/BDD framework
- [chai](https://github.com/logicalparadox/chai): The assertion code to use within mocha tests
- [sinon](https://github.com/cjohansen/Sinon.JS): A spy/stub/mock framework for testing more advanced/complex code
