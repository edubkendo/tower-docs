# Testing

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a quality of all great apps.  Once you master it you're able to not only develop a lot quicker, what you develop is also built on a much stronger foundation and will be more resilient in the face of change.

The problem with TDD, or BDD (Behavior Driven Development) even, is it's hard to get started with.  You could spend weeks if not months setting up a solid workflow for building your app around tests.  That's why Tower aims to make testing easy and clear.
