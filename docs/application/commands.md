# Commands

## `tower new <app-name> [options]`

## `tower server` (todo)

Right now, `node server` works well and is pure node.

## `tower console` (todo)

Use the Tower.js console to programmatically mess around with your application data.

```
tower console
```

## `tower generate <generator> [args] [options]`
