## Inspiration

- site where you can submit awesome sites

## Events (Attend)

- site like eventbrite

## Goal Tracker

- start timer when you start doing an event (watching movie), then every note you make can be tied to one of them.  This way you can easily mark "oh, at 38:57 in this movie there's a demonstration of leadership we need to cite in our book", etc.
