# Dotfiles

[Dotfiles](https://github.com/search?q=dotfiles&type=Everything&repo=&langOverride=&start_value=1) are for the most part just hidden files that different platforms use to store configuration data about your project.

In Tower.js, there's 3 by default:

- `.gitignore`
- `.npmignore`
- `.slugignore`

## `.gitignore`

This tells git the files and directories it should ignore.

## `.npmignore`

This tells npm what to ignore when your module is published.

## `.slugignore`

This tells Heroku what to ignore about your project.
