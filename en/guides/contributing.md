# Contributing to Tower

This guide is for developing Tower in a Mac OS X environment.

All contributions, either via master or the wiki, get credit in [Tower Contributors](http://towerjs.org/contributors) once we get that page up.

Also, we will create gists named `Tower.js Discussion - [topic goes here]` until GitHub has a Google Groups replacement.  I'm too much a fan of syntax highlighting to use Google Groups :)
