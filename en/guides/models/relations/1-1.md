# One-to-One Relationships

One to one relationships where the children are referenced in the parent record are defined using Tower's `@hasOne` and `@belongsTo` macros.

## Defining

The parent record of the relation should use the @hasOne macro to indicate is has *1* referenced child, where the record that is referenced in it uses `@belongsTo`.

```coffeescript
class App.User extends Tower.Model
  @hasOne "game"

class App.Game extends Tower.Model
  @field 'name', type: 'String'
  
  @belongsTo 'user'
```

Definitions are required on both sides to the relation in order for it to work properly.

### Storage

When defining a relation of this nature, each record is stored in it's respective collection, but the child record contains a "foreign key" reference to the parent.

```coffeescript
# The parent user record.
{ "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9") }

# The child post record.
{
  "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7f1"),
  "user_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9")
}
```

### Accessors

Accessing the relations is handled through the methods created based on the names of the relations. The following example shows basic access on both sides of the relation.

```coffeescript
# Return the child game.
user.get('game')

# Set the child game.
user.set('game', [ new App.Game ])

# Return the parent user.
game.get('user')

# Set the parent user.
game.get('user').build(new App.User)
```

### Build and Create

From the parent side, records in the referenced child can be initialized or created using the specially defined methods.

```coffeescript
# Create a new child game given the provided attributes.
user.get('game').build(name: "Tron")

# Create a persisted child game.
user.get('game').create(name: "Tron")

# Replace the parent with a new one from the attributes.
game.get('user').build(title: "Prince")

# Replace the parent with a newly saved one from the attributes.
game.get('user').create(title: "Prince")
```

=== Removal

Documents in the referenced many can be removed by either calling delete on the child or setting it to nil.

```coffeescript
# Delete the child record
user.get('game').destroy()
user.set('game', nil)
```

### Polymorphic behavior

When a child referenced record can belong to more than one type of parent record, you can tell Tower to support this by adding the as option to the definition on the parents, and the polymorphic option on the child.

```coffeescript
class App.Arcade extends Tower.Model
  @hasOne 'game', as: 'playable'

class App.User extends Tower.Model
  @hasOne 'game', as: 'playable'

class App.Game extends Tower.Model
  @belongsTo 'playable', polymorphic: true
```

### Dependent Behavior

You can tell Tower what to do with child relations of a has one when unsetting the relation via the dependent option. The valid options are:

* `'destroy'` Destroy the child record.
* `'nullify'` Orphan the child record.

Polymorphic example illustrating different kinds of dependency behavior:

```coffeescript
class App.User extends Tower.Model
  @hasOne 'game', as: 'playable', dependent: 'destroy'

class App.Arcade extends Tower.Model
  @hasOne 'game', as: 'playable', dependent: 'nullify'

# Deletes the existing game on the user.
user.set('game', [])
user.set('game', null)

# Orphans the existing game on the arcade (no delete).
user.set('game', [])
user.set('game', null)
```

If the dependent option is not defined, the default is to `nullify`.
