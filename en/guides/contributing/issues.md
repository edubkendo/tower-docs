## Feedback

You're encouraged to help improve the quality of this guide.

If you see any typos or factual errors you are confident to patch, please clone the wiki and push the change yourself. That branch of Tower has public write access. Commits are still reviewed, but that happens after you've submitted your contribution. the wiki is cross-merged with master periodically.

You may also find incomplete content, or stuff that is not up to date. Please do add any missing documentation for master.

If for whatever reason you spot something to fix but cannot patch it yourself, please open an issue.

And last but not least, any kind of discussion regarding Tower documentation is very welcome on the [Tower Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/towerjs).
