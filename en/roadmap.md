# Tower.js Roadmap

For 0.5.0, Tower will include the features below.  It's going to be a rolling list.  If you have ideas or features you'd like to see, include them in the section [Potential features](#potential-features) section and we'll move them up if they're in scope.

Let me know if you'd like to implement any of these things, will help speed up the process.

You are free to implement any of these features in any order… I'm more of a fan of doing what you want when you want to, as long as it follows some general plan.  I stay motivated and get way more done that way.

### 0.4.4 (models)

- basic model logging (so you can see things like database queries)
- remove dependency on mongodb
- uniqueness validation (database should not save a record unless specified attributes are globally unique (i.e. username))
- email/phone validation (and other common validation helpers)
- i18n (internationalization/localization, how to organize the random labels in the app, and prepare for translation into other languages)
- strict! validation
- confirmation validation

- test index creation in mongodb
- nested field queries ("addresses.city", etc.)
- mongo embedded documents
- test inheritance with type property
- `model#reload`
- acceptsNestedAttributes
- mass assignment security
- `find(id: null) # find by null`
- `where(name: "!=": "x")`
- `find(address: city: "San Diego") # nested doc/object queries`
- make `store` global, so you only have to apply it once, not per model.
  - makes testing easier.

<a name="0.5.0" href="0.5.0"></a>

### 0.5.0 (theme)

- well designed error/stacktrace page

<a name="0.5.1" href="0.5.1"></a>

### 0.5.1 (benchmarking)

- cache manifest: https://github.com/johntopley/manifesto
- integrate `"use strict";` into the codebase if possible
- benchmarks folder with stress tests

## Other todos

- compile all test/cases into tests.js to render on towerjs.org
- port most/all rails tests
- test `included` and `extended` callbacks
- make javascripts compile with function wrapper in Watchfile (for client)
- add `cid` or equaivalent
- think about making scopes use `get()`, so `App.User.get('recent')`. This way they can be used in views.
- handle app config:
  ``` ruby
  config.encoding = "utf-8"
  config.filter_parameters += [:password, :password_confirmation]
  config.time_zone = "Pacific Time (US & Canada)"
  ```
- make logs write to `./log` folder.

## Separate plugins

- Make a mocha web console reporter.
- User stamping
- Versioning
- Advanced (lucene) search (down the road)

### TowerPassport

- authentication extension (so it's easy to start using authentication, potentially with passport
- tower generate authentication Session
- see [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for inspiration, but I'm not a fan of devise b/c it's way too hard to customize and creates too much abstraction.  But the feature set it includes is great.  https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/OmniAuth:-Overview

### Tower.Authorization (Tower.Ability)

- authorization extension (https://github.com/ryanb/cancan)

### Tower.Attachment

- paperclip?

### NestedSet

- https://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set for hierarchical relationships

### Tower.Titanium

It's going to be very easy now to make Tower work with titanium mobile.  With coffeekup, you can have the form builder compile down to titanium objects no problem, something like:

``` coffeescript
App.View.helpers
  tabs: (options = {}) ->
    Titanium.UI.createTabGroup(options)
    
  tab: (options) ->
    options.window ||= @currentPane
    Titanium.UI.createTab(options)
    
  pane: (options, callback) ->
    @currentPane  = Titanium.UI.createWindow(options)
    callback()
```

``` coffeescript
tabs ->
  tab id: 'posts-tab', title: "Feed", ->
    pane title: "My Blog", ->
      table id: 'posts-table', data: App.Post.all()
```

## Support for alternative data stores (as plugins) 

These are next, larger features.  These will be included in earlier releases if a member of the community contributes them.  Otherwise they might be approached after the 0.5.0 release according to community requests.

- Neo4j support
- CouchDB support
- PostGreSQL support
- MySQL support
- SQLite3 support
- LocalStorage support
- Redis support

<a name="potential-features" href="potential-features"></a>

## Potential Features

- hierarchical models (nested sets)
- ~~state machine (see [https://github.com/pluginaweek/stateMachine](https://github.com/pluginaweek/stateMachine))~~ Ember.js has this built in!
- need to think about having a separate library like https://github.com/flamejs/flame.js that handles common components.  Definitely tower should work without this, but these components may be useful.

## Random Issues

- need to figure out how to append fields to a model base class after the other models have been subclassed.
- convert modules to `Ember.Mixin` objects. 
- convert all `class X` in tower to `.extend`, just javascript
