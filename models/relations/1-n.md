# One-to-Many Relationships

One to many relationships where the children are stored in a separate collection from the parent document are defined using Tower's has_many and belongs_to macros. This exhibits similar behaviour to Active Record.

## Defining

The parent document of the relation should use the has_many macro to indicate is has n number of referenced children, where the document that is referenced uses belongs_to.

``` coffeescript
class App.User extends Tower.Model
  @hasMany "posts"

class Post extends Tower.Model
  @field "title", type: "String"
  @belongsTo "user"
```

Definitions are required on both sides to the relation in order for it to work properly.

## Storage

When defining a relation of this nature, each document is stored in it's respective collection, but the child document contains a "foreign key" reference to the parent.

``` coffeescript
# The parent user document.
{ "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9") }

# The child post document.
{
  "_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7f1"),
  "user_id" : ObjectId("4d3ed089fb60ab534684b7e9")
}
```

## Accessors

Accessing the relations is handled through the methods created based on the names of the relations. The following example shows basic access on both sides of the relation.

``` coffeescript
# Return the child posts.
user.posts().all()

# Set the child posts.
user.posts().set([new Post])

# Return the parent user.
post.user()

# Set the parent user.
post.user().create(User.new)
```

## Building and Creating

From the parent side, documents in the referenced child can be appended to using traditional array syntax or the special association proxy methods. On the child side the only option is to replace the existing with a newly built or created document.

``` coffeescript
# Append one or many child posts, saving them if the user is persisted.
user.posts().create(new Post)
user.posts().push(new Post)

# Appends and returns a new child post from the attirbutes.
user.posts().build(title: "Berlin never sleeps.")
user.posts().new(title: "Berlin never sleeps.")

# Appends, saves, and returns a new child post from the attirbutes.
user.posts().create(title: "Berlin is far cooler than New York.")

# Replace the parent with a new one from the attributes.
post.buildUser(title: "Prince")

# Replace the parent with a newly saved one from the attributes.
post.createUser(title: "Prince")

## Removal

Documents in the referenced many can be removed in several different manners, either through the relation, criteria, or accessors.

``` coffeescript
# Delete all referenced documents
user.posts().delete()
user.posts().destroy()
user.posts().clear()
user.posts().set([])

# Delete all matching referenced documents.
user.posts().where(title: "Berlin").delete()

# Delete the parent referenced document.
post.user().delete()

## Finding

Finding documents in the referenced children is handled through find or by using chained criteria on the relation.

``` coffeescript
# Find a child by a single or multiple ids.
user.posts().find(id)
user.posts().find([ id_one, id_two ])

# Find matching referenced children.
user.posts().where(title: "Berlin")

# Do any children exist that are persisted?
user.posts().exists()
```

## Polymorphic Behavior

When a child referenced document can belong to more than one type of parent document, you can tell Tower to support this by adding the as option to the definition on the parents, and the polymorphic option on the child.

``` coffeescript
class Company extends Tower.Model
  @hasMany "posts", as: "postable"

class User extends Tower.Model
  @hasMany "posts", as: "postable"

class Post extends Tower.Model
  @belongsTo "postable", polymorphic: true
```

## Dependent Behavior

You can tell Tower what to do with child relations of a has many when unsetting the relation via the dependent option. This also applies to calling #delete on the relation. The valid options are:

- `"delete"`: Delete the child documents.
- `"destroy"`: Destroy the child documents.
- `"nullify"`: Orphan the child documents.

``` coffeescript
class Company extends Tower.Model
  @hasMany "posts", as: "postable", dependent: "delete"

class User extends Tower.Model
  @hasMany "posts", as: "postable", dependent: "nullify"

# Delete all the child relations:
company.posts().set([])
company.posts().set(null)
company.posts().clear()
company.posts().delete()

# Orphan all the child relations:
user.posts().delete()

# Delete a single child relation:
company.posts().delete(post)

# Orphan a single child relation:
user.posts().delete(post)
```

If the dependent option is not defined, the default is to nullify.
